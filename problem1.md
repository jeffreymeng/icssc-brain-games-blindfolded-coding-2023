## Problem 1. Warming Up

Your team has recently learned about the secret ICSSC brain cell laboratory in the 
basement of Rowland Hall! You've decided to break in to steal some of these 
precious brain cells for yourself. Before you can start breaking in though, 
you need to do some warm up exercises to practice your coordination.

Write a function `warm_up()` that prints nine things (by calling `print()` nine times):

- print `l3tz dooo this`
- print the answer to: 23 to the power of 5
- print `there they're their it's ok`
- print `"`
- print `a double quote`
- print `bob then the words a quote then an actual quote`
- print the number of bytes in a bit (as an integer)
- print `hi wait you typed it wrong go back two characters ok this time you really did type it wrong press delete stop`
- print the computed result of the largest of these three values: 248 to the power of 30, 4 to the power of 200, 45 to the power of 45
