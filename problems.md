# Problems
*Though the theme is sequential, you may complete problems in any order.*

### Rules
- You must choose a programmer to be blindfolded before seeing each problem. The programmer must stay blindfolded for the
entire duration of that problem.
- You may switch programmers in between problems, but not during a problem. (Nobody who's seen the problem can be the programmer for that problem)
- If you switch problems without finishing them, you must also switch back to the original programmer for that problem.
